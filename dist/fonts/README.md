Place your Sk-Modernist webfont files in this directory so the site can load them.

Recommended filenames (used by CSS in `styles.css`):
- `Sk-Modernist.woff2`  (preferred, modern browsers)
- `Sk-Modernist.woff`   (fallback)

Notes:
- Sk-Modernist is a commercial/licensed font. Do not commit the font files to a public repository unless you hold the rights or the license allows it.
- If you have italic or variable fonts, add additional `@font-face` rules to `styles.css` for those variants.
- After adding the files, restart the dev server (`npm run dev`) if it's running so the files are served correctly.
